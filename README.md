## Why should you want me in your team?
- I'm reliable, motivated and hard working;
- I'm communicative and helpful, coworkers appreciate my positive attitude and say I'm good to work with;
- I'm a problem solver, I always search for solutions and don't give up because of a sigle error (or a two-day string of errors either);
- I pay attention to detail and make sure the effects of my work are clear, readable and helpful.
